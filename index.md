Background:
We successfully managed and released the OWASP Top 10 Insider Threats Version 2023 last year and had overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community. Currently, we are propagating the project. This year in November we will speak about our project on the German OWASP day 2024. Additionally, we are currently speaking with news sites and similar to promote the project and rise awareness about it. This October, there will be a news article in the big German Heise / iX Tech-Journal. Also, we are planning to present the project next year on the international OWASP conference.

Project Description:
Based on this project we want to expand this field, regarding insider threats and vulnerabilities in infrastructures, and want to create a full testing guide regarding this topic. We whish to create a testing guide for infrastructure peneteration testing to standardize this process.
